# Easy Share

Easy Share is a tool to easily share files over the network.

## How is it different from other similar tools ?

Easy share lets you upload your file to the server and provides you with a unique token which you can use to view them at your leisure.
This is different from other similar services as this will simply let you view the file even without downloading it.

## How to run this ?

This is a flask app, and runs by simply running `python app.py`.
Make sure you install the dependencies before you run this, by running `pip install -p requirements.txt` in the root folder.

## File types supported
As of now, Easy share can preview these file types:
- Image files
- Video files
- PDF files
- Audio files

Support for text files will be available soon.
